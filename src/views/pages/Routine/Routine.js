          The Pomodoro Technique was invented in the early 90s by developer,
          entrepeneur, and author Francesco Cirillo. Cirillo named the system
          "Pomodoro" after the tomato-shaped timer he used to track his work as
          a university student. The methodology is simple: When faced with any
          large task or series of tasks, break the work down into short, timed
          intervals (called "Pomodoros") that are spaced out by short breaks.
          This trains your brain to focus for short periods and helps you stay
          on top of deadlines or constantly-refilling inboxes. With time it can
          even help improve your attention span and concentration . Pomodoro is
          a cyclical system. You work in short sprints , which makes sure you're
          consistently productive. You also get to take regular breaks that
          bolster your motivation and keep you creative.
